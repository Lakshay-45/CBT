Project Charter: Project Phoenix

1. Project Overview & Purpose

Project Phoenix is a strategic initiative by Innovate Inc. to completely redesign and relaunch our primary customer-facing mobile application. The current application, "InnovateApp 2.0," has seen a 15% decline in user engagement over the last fiscal year due to an outdated user interface and performance issues. The purpose of this project is to deliver a modern, fast, and intuitive mobile experience to increase user retention by 25% and improve our App Store rating from 3.5 to at least 4.5 stars within six months of launch.

2. Project Goals & Objectives

-   Goal 1: Enhance User Experience (UX): Redesign the entire UI/UX to be modern, intuitive, and aligned with current design best practices.
-   Goal 2: Improve Performance: Reduce average app load time from 4 seconds to under 1 second. Decrease crash rates by 90%.
-   Goal 3: Introduce New Features: Integrate a personalized user dashboard, in-app chat support, and a loyalty rewards program.
-   Goal 4: Increase Adoption: Achieve 100,000 active users within the first quarter post-launch.

3. Scope

-   In-Scope:
    -   Full redesign of the iOS and Android mobile applications.
